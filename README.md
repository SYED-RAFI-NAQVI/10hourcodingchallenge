# 10hourcodingchallenge


10hourscodingchallenge is inspired by 10 years challenge by Talent Accurate.
        

        This repository is the path of learning, This started as a coding challenge first but on the way collected a lot of stuff.
        started learning image processing while this coding challenge... The start is very small by installing OpenCV library. At the end of the coding challenge,, I reached where I build a small image processing project which converts the low light picture to high threshold picture.


                for the beginners, this repository will use a lot where each line of code have the comment as an explanation

# Project

 The project is bulid to chage the low light image into high threshold threshold image whith openCV.
